          In 2020, I embarked on my web development journey, starting with
          frontend technologies like React, Vue.js, and Angular. I didn't stop
          thereâ€”I also dived into backend development, adding PHP to my skill
          set and attended boot camps to enrich my knowledge.

          In 2023, I gained valuable experience as a junior frontend developer
          at Programmingo, where I specialized in Vue.js and embraced agile
          teamwork. Now, I'm eager to bring my skills and passion to new
          challenges. While I excel in frontend development, I'm open to backend
          opportunities.

              At Programmingo, I specialized in Vue.js. My role encompassed bug
              fixes, feature enhancements, and design improvements. Working
              closely with the team of experienced professionals at
              Programmingo, I not only mastered Vue.js but also thrived in a
              collaborative environment, making valuable contributions to
              project success.
