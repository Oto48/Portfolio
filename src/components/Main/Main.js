        <p>
          In 2020, I embarked on my web development journey, starting with
          frontend technologies like React, Vue.js, and Angular. I didn't stop
          thereâ€”I also dived into backend development, adding PHP to my skill
          set and attended boot camps to enrich my knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2023, I gained valuable experience as a junior frontend developer
          at Programmingo, where I specialized in Vue.js and embraced agile
          teamwork. Now, I'm eager to bring my skills and passion to new
          challenges. While I excel in frontend development, I'm open to backend
          opportunities.
